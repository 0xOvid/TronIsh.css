# TronIsh.css
Css for styling web pages to have a more tron inspired look. 
The look is based of edex-ui (https://github.com/GitSquared/edex-ui).
The general idea is to have a lightweight and sleek looking web style that can be used for various web based GUIs, making stuff look professional while not overwhelming the end user.

## Demo
Below is a screenshot showing the general look and feel of the style.

## Use
To include this style in your projects simply download the .css file and include it in the header of your html
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link  rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"  href="./style.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

## TODO and general idea:
The hopefull final version of this can also be used to create a "virtual desktop" enviornment for moving my main blog and resources over, with the general idea is to in the end get a nice and good loking repo for my projects and blog posts.
With the end goal of having these useful as a repo and place to look up info and techniques.
